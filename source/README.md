# Structural and functional connectome coupling (SC-FC coupling)
source code for extracting data and analysis for paper [Regional structural-functional connectome coupling is heritable and associated with age, sex and cognition in adults](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.09.417725v1). 

Heritability analysis model is adopted from previous paper [Heritability analysis with repeat measurements and its
application to resting-state functional connectivity](https://www.pnas.org/content/114/21/5521/tab-article-info). Please cite if you use the model.
