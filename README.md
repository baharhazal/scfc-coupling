# Structural and functional connectome coupling (SC-FC coupling)
scripts for extracting data and analysis for paper "xxxxx"
Heritability analysis model is adopted from previous paper [Heritability analysis with repeat measurements and its
application to resting-state functional connectivity](https://www.pnas.org/content/114/21/5521/tab-article-info). Please cite if you use the model.

## Steps
1. Prepare all your files (SC, FC data and the demographics). HCP data is available upon request.
2. Run demo.py which contains a simple demo for extracting data and analysis. Results will be saved.
